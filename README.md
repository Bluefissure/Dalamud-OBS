# Dalamud-OBS

A Dalamud plugin that communicates with OBS by websocket.

## Requirements

You need to install two plugins to your OBS:

- [OBS-websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/releases/latest): for communication with this plugin.
- [StreamFX](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/releases/latest): for the blur function.

## Installation

You can enable the testing plugins in Dalamud settings.

Or you can add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bluefissure/Dalamud-OBS/master/repo.json` as a third-party repo in Dalamud settings.
